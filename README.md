## Introduction
This repo serves as an RFI response for the EPA. It is a working prototype based on a public environmental dataset, specifically, Fuel Economy Mileage Ratings for 2016.

## Technologies

The team identified open-source, reusable frameworks as the basic underpinning of the site to allow the creation of both application and infrastructure as quickly as possible while ensuring a good-quality product and environment.  The fuel economy app is based on the following technologies:

These technologies allow for the rapid creation of **_single-page application_** with dynamic response and a mobile-responsive design.

### DevOps Infrastructure

The following technologies provided reusable components which allowed for the easy and fast creation of a DevOps infrastructure to build, test and deploy the code baseline:

        Bower manages the package dependencies for this AngularJS application.  This include AngularJS, Firebase, Bootstrap and JQuery.  Bower, injects into index.html references to all listed dependencies via a Grunt task, ensuring that specific versions of these packages are used across the entire project.

## Site Design Approach



### Discover
Frame the problem and existing experience by gaining a full understanding of the questions, scope, and overall context forÂ the service.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTeDlUynA4I">Interviews</a>

### Describe
Define the service by synthesizing research and producing high level concepts by defining the differentiating ideas and key indicators for success.

### Design
Bring the service to life by conceiving, prototyping, evaluating, and refining the service experience.

### Develop
Create tangible solutions in collaboration with developers to test, produce and deliver all of the needed components for the service design language.

### Release
Help the service go to market and iterate and improve on it after its release.
